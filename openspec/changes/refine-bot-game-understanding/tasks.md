## 3. Strategic Primitives

### T010 Implement Phase-Based Weight Modifiers ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Add `getStrategicModifiers(state, seat, theta)` function
  - **Establish mana base** (turns 1-3, sites < 3): return `{ play_site: +2.0, play_unit: +0.5 }`
  - **Deploy threats** (sites ≥ 3, threats = 0): return `{ play_minion: +1.5, play_site: -0.5 }`
  - **Apply pressure** (threats > 0, opp life < 15): return `{ attack: +1.2, play_site: -1.0 }`
  - **Defend lethal** (opp damage potential ≥ bot life): return `{ play_blocker: +5.0, attack: -2.0 }`
- Integrate into `evalFeatures()`: multiply base score by modifier
- Add unit tests: verify modifiers activate at correct thresholds
- **Validation**: Bot on turn 2 with 1 site prioritizes playing site over passing; bot on turn 5 with 4 sites prioritizes playing minion

### T011 Conditional Feature Extraction ⚠️ PARTIAL
- [ ] Update `extractFeatures()` to call `getStrategicModifiers()`
- Note: Strategic modifiers implemented but not yet integrated into search scoring
- Apply modifiers to candidate scores before ranking
- Add integration test: verify turn-by-turn priority shifts (sites early → units mid → attacks late)
- **Validation**: Self-play match logs show phase transitions: mana base → threat deployment → pressure application

## 4. Candidate Generation Refinement

### T012 Prioritize Unit Deployment Candidates ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Rewrite `generateCandidates()` to:
  1. Generate all affordable unit-playing candidates (up to 8)
  2. Generate site-playing candidates (up to 3) only if `sites < 4` OR no units affordable
  3. Generate movement/attack candidates (up to 4)
  4. Generate draw/pass candidates (always include)
- Add `filterPlayableUnits(state, seat)` helper
  - Filter hand by `canAffordCard()`
  - Return up to 8 playable units
- Add unit tests: verify unit candidates appear before site candidates when both affordable
- **Validation**: Bot with 4 sites and affordable 3-cost minion generates 1 unit candidate + 1 site candidate (not 8 site candidates)

### T013 Gate Site-Playing After Mana Base Established ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Add logic to `generateCandidates()`:
  - If `sites >= 6`, deprioritize site candidates (move to end of list)
  - If `sites >= 6` and no affordable units, prefer "draw spell" over "play site"
- Add unit tests: verify site candidates ranked last when sites ≥ 6
- **Validation**: Bot with 7 sites and no affordable units draws from spellbook instead of playing 8th site

### T014 Limit Branching Factor ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Cap `generateCandidates()` to return ≤ 16 total candidates
- Prioritize by strategic relevance:
  1. Lethal attacks (if available)
  2. Affordable units (up to 8)
  3. Movement toward opponent (up to 4)
  4. Sites (up to 3)
  5. Draw/pass (always include)
- Add unit tests: verify cap enforced; verify priority ordering
- **Validation**: Training logs show `candidates.length <= 16` on all turns

## 5. Telemetry and Diagnostics

### T015 Enhanced JSONL Logging ✅ COMPLETE

  - [x] Add `evaluationBreakdown`: object with per-feature contributions
    - Example: `{ board_development: 3.2, mana_efficiency: -1.5, threat_deployment: 4.8, total: 6.5 }`
  - [x] Add `candidateDetails`: array with action labels, scores, legality
    - Example: `[{ action: "play_unit:Blacksmith_Family", score: 4.5, refined: 8.2, isLegal: true }, ...]`
  - [x] Add `filteredCandidates`: count of illegal moves pruned
    - Example: `{ totalUnitsInHand: 5, filteredUnaffordable: 3, playableUnits: 2, sitesGated: false, candidatesGenerated: 9, candidatesAfterLimit: 9 }`
- [x] Created `evalFeaturesWithBreakdown()` helper function for per-feature scoring
- [x] Enhanced `generateCandidates()` to track filtering stats
- [x] Updated logger call to include all three new fields
- [ ] Update `scripts/training/selfplay.js` to write enhanced logs (logs already enhanced by engine)
- [ ] Add log parsing script `scripts/training/analyze-logs.js` to compute:
  - Variance of `rootEval` across turns
  - % of turns with meaningful actions (non-pass when mana ≥ 3)
  - Average `mana_wasted` in turns 5+
- **Validation**: Logs include `evaluationBreakdown`; analysis script runs without errors

### T016 Regression Detection Automation
- Add `detectRegressions()` function in `scripts/training/analyze-logs.js`
  - Check: if `rootEval` variance < 0.1, flag "zero-variance regression"
  - Check: if % site-playing turns 5-15 > 80% while mana ≥ 3, flag "site-spam pathology"
  - Check: if average game length > 50 turns, flag "infinite stalemate"
- Integrate into `selfplay.js`: halt training if regression detected
- Add unit tests: verify detection with synthetic logs
- **Validation**: Inject broken theta (all weights = 0); confirm training halts with diagnostic message

## 6. Rulebook Integration

### T017 Map Rulebook Rules to Bot Logic
- Create `reference/bot-rulebook-mapping.md`:
  - **PLACEMENT rules** → implemented in `playSitePatch()` (first site at Avatar pos, adjacent to owned)
  - **COST rules** → implemented in `canAffordCard()` (mana and thresholds)
  - **TIMING rules** → implemented in `generateCandidates()` (Main-phase gating)
  - **COMBAT rules** → implemented in `generateMoveCandidates()` (orthogonal adjacency)
  - **WINNING THE GAME** → implemented in `detectWinCondition()` (death's door, death blow)
- Document coverage gaps for v2: regions, instants, triggered abilities
- **Validation**: Manual review confirms all v1 rules mapped

### T018 Validate Against Reference Rules
- Create test suite `tests/bot-rules-validation.test.js`:
  - Load `reference/BotRules.csv`
  - For each PLACEMENT rule, verify `playSitePatch()` enforces constraint
  - For each COST rule, verify `canAffordCard()` rejects violations
  - For each TIMING rule, verify `generateCandidates()` respects phase
- Run tests; fix any violations
- **Validation**: All rulebook tests pass

## 7. Training Validation

### T019 Baseline Functional Play Smoke Test
- Update `scripts/training/selfplay.js` to run smoke test before training:
  - Run 10 self-play matches with baseline theta
  - Validate:
    - ≥70% of turns with mana ≥ 3 result in non-site, non-pass actions
    - Average game length < 30 turns
    - `rootEval` variance ≥ 1.0
  - If fails, halt with error message
- Add smoke test to CI/CD pipeline
- **Validation**: Smoke test passes with refined theta; fails with broken (all-zeros) theta

### T020 Champion Gating on Functional Play
- Update champion selection logic in `scripts/training/selfplay.js`:
  - Require win rate ≥ 55% vs. previous champion over ≥100 matches
  - Require average `mana_wasted` in turns 5+ ≤ 4.0
  - Require ≥60% of turns with mana ≥ 3 result in unit/spell played
  - Require all games end within 30 turns
- Reject theta candidates failing criteria even if Elo higher
- Log rejection reason
- **Validation**: Inject theta with high Elo but site-spam behavior; confirm rejection with diagnostic

### T021 Update Champion Theta with Refined Weights
- Create `data/bots/params/champion-v2.yaml`:
  - Copy baseline theta from `loadTheta()`
  - Set `meta.id = "refined/v2"`
  - Set `meta.description = "Hand-tuned weights with mana/threshold enforcement"`
- Run 20 self-play matches; validate functional play
- Replace `data/bots/params/champion.yaml` with v2
- **Validation**: Bot plays minions on turn 4-7; attacks on turn 8+; games end with victory in <20 turns

## 8. Documentation and Examples

## 12. Card-Specific Understanding (Phase 2 - LLM-Based)

**Note**: This section represents follow-up work to be done AFTER generic evaluation (T001-T032) is complete and functional.

### T033 Design LLM-Based Card Understanding System
- Create `specs/card-understanding/spec.md`:
  - **Problem**: Generic evaluation treats all cards equally (Divine Healing = Overpower = Flood)
  - **Solution**: Parse `rulesText` with LLM to generate card-specific evaluation functions
  - **Approach**:
    1. Extract `rulesText` from database for all cards
    2. Send to LLM with prompt: "Generate evaluation function for this card effect"
    3. LLM outputs: category (healing/combat-trick/board-clear/etc.), situational modifiers, priority hints
    4. Cache generated evaluations in `data/cards/card-evaluations.json`
  - **Example**:
    ```json
    {
      "Divine Healing": {
        "category": "healing",
        "evaluation": "return myLife < 10 ? 5.0 : (myLife < 15 ? 2.0 : 0.5)",
        "priority": "high when low life, low when healthy",
        "rulesText": "You gain 7 life."
      }
    }
    ```
- Document LLM prompt templates and evaluation function schema
- **Validation**: Manual review confirms schema is expressive enough for 80% of card types

### T034 Implement Card Evaluation Cache System
- Create `bots/card-evaluations/loader.js`:
  - Load `data/cards/card-evaluations.json` at startup
  - Expose `getCardEvaluation(cardName)` API
  - Return evaluation function as executable JavaScript
- Update `enrichPatchWithCosts()` to also include `evaluation` field:
  ```js
  enriched.zones[seat][zoneName] = cards.map(card => ({
    ...card,
    cost: costMap.get(card.name),
    evaluation: evaluationCache.get(card.name), // NEW
    rulesText: rulesTextMap.get(card.name)
  }));
  ```
- Add fallback: if no cached evaluation, use generic category heuristic
- **Validation**: Bot receives evaluation functions for 509 cards in cache

### T035 Generate Evaluations for Common Cards
- Create `scripts/generate-card-evaluations.js`:
  - Query database for all cards with `rulesText`
  - For each card, call LLM with prompt:
    ```
    Given this card effect: "{rulesText}"
    Generate a JavaScript evaluation function that returns a numeric score (0-10)
    based on game state. The function receives: { myLife, oppLife, myUnits, oppUnits, myMana, turn }

    Example input: "You gain 7 life."
    Example output: "return myLife < 10 ? 8.0 : (myLife < 15 ? 3.0 : 0.5)"
    ```
  - Validate generated code compiles
  - Write results to `data/cards/card-evaluations.json`
- Start with 50 most common cards in constructed decks
- **Validation**: 50 evaluation functions generated successfully; spot-check 10 for correctness

### T036 Integrate Card-Specific Evaluation into Search
- Update `evalFeatures()` to call card evaluation functions:
  ```js
  function evalFeatures(f, w, candidateAction, state, seat) {
    let baseScore = /* existing generic evaluation */;

    // Add card-specific bonus if playing a card
    if (candidateAction.type === 'play_card') {
      const card = candidateAction.card;
      const evalFn = card.evaluation;
      if (evalFn) {
        const context = buildEvalContext(state, seat);
        const cardBonus = evalFn(context);
        baseScore += cardBonus;
      }
    }

    return baseScore;
  }
  ```
- Add `buildEvalContext()` helper to extract: myLife, oppLife, myUnits, oppUnits, myMana, turn
- **Validation**: Bot with Divine Healing prioritizes playing it when life < 10, ignores when life = 20

### T037 Expand Coverage to All Card Types
- Extend evaluation generation to all 509 cards in database
- Handle edge cases:
  - Cards with complex targeting (e.g., "Choose a unit...")
  - Cards with conditional effects (e.g., "If opponent controls...")
  - Cards with regional effects (future: ignore for v1)
- For unsupported cards, fall back to generic category heuristics
- **Validation**: Coverage report shows 80%+ of cards have specific evaluations; 20% use fallback

### T038 Add Card Synergy Detection
- Enhance LLM prompt to identify synergies:
  ```
  Does this card synergize with other cards? Examples:
  - "Overpower" synergizes with "attacking units" (combat trick)
  - "Blacksmith Family" synergizes with "fire threshold cards" (mana fixing)
  Output: { synergies: ["attacking_units"], antiSynergies: ["no_units"] }
  ```
- Update evaluation functions to check for synergy conditions
- **Validation**: Bot with Overpower prefers to play it when units are positioned to attack

### T039 Unit Test Card Evaluation Functions
- Create `tests/bot/card-evaluations.test.js`:
  - For each card category, create test scenarios:
    - **Healing**: Low life (expect high score), high life (expect low score)
    - **Combat Trick**: Units attacking (high), no units (low)
    - **Board Clear**: Opponent has many units (high), few units (low)
  - Verify evaluation functions return expected scores
- All tests pass
- **Validation**: 95%+ of card evaluation tests pass

### T040 Self-Play Validation with Card Understanding
- Run 50 self-play matches comparing:
  - **Baseline**: Generic evaluation only (no card-specific understanding)
  - **Enhanced**: Generic + card-specific evaluation
- Measure:
  - Win rate of enhanced vs. baseline (expect ≥65%)
  - Average game quality (e.g., Divine Healing used appropriately)
  - Strategic diversity (different card types played in appropriate situations)
- Document results in `openspec/changes/refine-bot-game-understanding/card-understanding-validation.md`
- **Validation**: Enhanced bot shows measurably better strategic decision-making

### T041 Documentation for Card Understanding System
- Create `docs/bot-card-understanding.md`:
  - Explain LLM-based evaluation generation pipeline
  - Document evaluation function schema and context API
  - Provide examples of adding custom evaluations for new cards
  - Troubleshooting guide for invalid generated functions
- Add section to `bots/engine/README.md` explaining card evaluation system
- **Validation**: Documentation enables adding new card evaluations without engineering support

### T042 Production Integration and Monitoring
- Add telemetry to track card evaluation usage:
  - Log when card-specific evaluations influence decisions
  - Track which cards lack evaluations (fallback used)
  - Monitor evaluation function execution time
- Set up alerts for:
  - Evaluation functions that error during execution
  - Cards with >10% fallback usage (need better evaluations)
- **Validation**: Telemetry dashboard shows card evaluation impact on decision quality
